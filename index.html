        <p>I am a mysterious figure, the son of an Indian raja. A scientific visionary, I roam the depths of the seas in my submarine, the Nautilus, which was assembled from parts manufactured in several different countries, then shipped to a cover address. I am consumed by a hunger for hatred of imperialism and Indian Cuisine.</p>
        <p>Join me on the journey as I try out different recipes and be a part of <strong>The Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Kitchen Roof.</strong></p>
